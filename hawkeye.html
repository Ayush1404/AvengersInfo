			<p> Hawkeye, American comic book superhero created for Marvel Comics by writer Stan Lee and artist Don Heck. The costumed archer first appeared in Tales of Suspense no. 57 (September 1964).

Hawkeye; Avengers, theThe man who would become known as Hawkeye was born Clint Barton. Orphaned at an early age, he joined the circus and apprenticed himself to the Swordsman, a performer who specialized in tricks with blades. After he discovered the Swordsman stealing from the circus, the two fought, and Barton was left for dead. Barton recovered, and he continued his martial training with the circus’s resident archer, Trickshot. Barton excelled with the bow, and he decided to use his skills to embark on a career as a costumed crime fighter named Hawkeye. After some initial misadventures, Hawkeye proved his worth to the Avengers, and he was a regular member of that group’s rotating cast throughout the 1960s. At the end of that decade, he used a growth serum developed by fellow Avenger Hank Pym and became the giant-sized Goliath, a role he kept for the next several years.
